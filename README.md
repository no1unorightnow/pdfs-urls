PDFs that are behind form-walls

Ya know how a bunch of things need an email, before giving you a direct URL to the PDF? But of course the email need is just to spam you..

Usually, you can put in test @ example.com, or similar, and boom! URL given after submit. Sometimes, though, they actually make you check your email for the URL. Either way, this repository is designed to work around that "feature".
